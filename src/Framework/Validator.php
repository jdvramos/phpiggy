// Not only our validator can use the default rules but users of 
// our framework can also add their own rules to the validator as long
// as the rule follows the RuleInterface contract

// Our Validator class is only responsible on how to store the rules and how
// to perform validations. It is not responsible on which field to validate 
// and what rule to use to validate that field from, this is the responsibility
// of the Application to provide for the framework which is in 
// the ValidatorService class.

// As a rule of thumb, the Framework should be considered tools, they should know
// the 'How' but not the 'What'. For example, our Router knows how to store routes
// and dispatch routes. However, it doesn't know what routes should be available in 
// the application. It's up to our Application to register routes (registerRoutes). 
// The same idea applies to our Container, our Container knows how to store
// dependencies and how to instantiate them. On the other hand, it doesn't
// have an immediate list of dependencies, our Application is responsible for
// registering the dependencies (container-definitions)
